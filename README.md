# music-mood-app
My project is called Music-mood .
Its an app that can store your playlist under your mood, that users would be able to download with the API that I'am using.
The API that I used is from last.fm it only provides the artist and song. I also used AUTH for my app, the only way you can use the app is by signing up for it.

<form method="POST" action='/musics/search'>
  <input name='artist' type='text' placeholder='artist' />
  <input name='song' type='text' placeholder='title' />
  <input type='submit' value='Add!' />
</form>
-- This is a part of my code that I'am mostly proud of because I spend hours trying to debug it. The / before music was the reason why the songs I searched were coming up ad undefined. 

One feature that I would like to add to my app would be for it to be able to play the songs after you add them on to the playlist.
